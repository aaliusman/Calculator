# Calculator
- I would recommend to use IntelliJ or Eclipse to execute autoamtion test cases for Calculator.
- You can clone this repo by using git clone https://github.com/aaliusman/Calculator.git
- Go to src/main/java/calc/TestCalculator, right click and Run 'Test Calculator'
- That should run all test cases in one run.
